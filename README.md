# Description
A web app performing the functions of a scientific calculator. Built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# Changes Made
The overall body of the calculator has been reduced in size to accomodate smaller screens. For varying screen sizes, the calculator is positioned slightly differently so it looks (near enough) centered on all screen sizes.
